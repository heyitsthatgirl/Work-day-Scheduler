# Work Day Scheduler

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple schedule application that allows the user to add important events into a daily planner.

How to Use:

When the user opens the application they will see the current day and time displayed at the top of the page. <br/>

The user can then select the time block they wish to schedule, type in an event, and click the save icon to save the event to the schedule.<br/>

The text the user entered will stay on the schedule, even if they refresh their page.<br/>

The schedule is color coded by past, present, and future so that the user can easily see what task needs to be done at that time.<br/>

More info:

The Work Day Scheduler was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Day.js.<br/>
